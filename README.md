## 🚀 Project 1: Global Sales & Logistics Report (Power BI)

**Objective:** Transform raw sales data into an interactive dashboard to identify profit drivers and shipping inefficiencies.

### 🖼️ Dashboard Preview

### 🧩 Key Features
* **Logistics Optimization:** Used **Decomposition Tree** AI visual to break down shipping costs and return rates by region and mode.
* **Profitability Analysis:** Identified that while "Furniture" drives volume, "Technology" drives profit margins (ROS).
* **Navigation:** Created a custom app-like sidebar for seamless switching between Sales, Product, and Shipping views.
* **Time Intelligence:** Implemented DAX measures for Year-over-Year (YoY) growth comparison.

### 📂 File Structure
